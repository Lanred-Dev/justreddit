# justreddit

A simple no-dependency Reddit API wrapper for getting post, comment, and subreddit metadata. This package does not provide authorization functionality for the Reddit API; it simply uses public endpoints.

## Getting Started

> Current release (**5.0.0+**) requires **Node.js 21.0.0** at minimum.

First, install **justreddit** using this npm command:

```sh
npm i justreddit
```

Next, import it into your project:

```js
# CommonJS
const justreddit = require("justreddit");
# ESM
import justreddit from "justreddit";
```

And now you're ready to start using **justreddit** üòé

## Usage

#### Subreddits

Getting a subreddit's information:

```ts
# NOTE: Replace `javascript` with the name of the subreddit
justreddit.sub("javascript");
```

Or want to change it up and get a random subreddit?

```ts
justreddit.randomSub();
```

#### Posts

Getting a post's information:

```ts
# Note: Replace `javascript` with the name of the subreddit
# Note: Replace `6hz7o6` with the ID of the post
justreddit.post("javascript", "6hz7o6");
```

Don't have a post in mind? In that case, you can get a random one:

```ts
# Note: Both `subreddit` and `sortingOption` are optional parameters
# `randomPost` will get the top posts from all of Reddit if no subreddit is provided.
justreddit.randomPost(subreddit, sortingOption);
```

#### Replies

Getting a reply's information:

```ts
# Note: Replace `javascript` with the name of the subreddit
# Note: Replace `6hz7o6` with the ID of the post
# Note: Replace `dj2ky54` with the ID of the reply
justreddit.reply("javascript", "6hz7o6", "dj2ky54");
```
